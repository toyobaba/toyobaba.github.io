description: Designed and verified foundry ready 7nm series and parallel stacked FinFETs using Cadence Virtuoso to provide insights into effects of scaling on key device parameters. ●Developed an automated R, Java, and python basedreporting system for data analysis and charting for millions of rows of experimental electrical data on 7nm FinFET DUTsto provide insights into Local Layout Effects (LLE) on key device parameters. ●Used  modern  R  packages  like  rshiny, rconnect,  dplyr,  ggplot2,  data.table,  etc.  to  develop  a  web  accessible  charting and  report generation application for the Advance Technology Department team.
